	Invert a binary tree.

	Trivia:
	This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
	Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

	Definition for a binary tree node.

	    def initialize(val)
	        @val = val
	        @left, @right = nil, nil
	    end
	end
